# Google

Hello, world!

This is my fist project that I completed by re-implementing Google's Homepage, Advanced Search and Image Search.

In this project, I used pure HTML & CSS. I implemented this project by using Harvard's CS50 Web course. 

Here comes the features of each section:

<h2> Homepage </h2>

<h3> Google Search </h3>

After a query, the search button routes user to the related google search's result page.

<h3> I'm Feeling Lucky </h3>

After a query, the I'm Feeling Lucky button routes user to the first google search's result page.

<h2> Image Search </h2>

After a query, user gets directed o the related google image search's result page.

<h2> Advanced Search </h2>

Depending on the form used, user gets directed to the related google search resul's page with user's demand (such as including/excluding a word from a query)
